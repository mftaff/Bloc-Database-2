1) A subquery is when you use the results of a query in a query. For example to 
only SELECT something WHERE it is present in some other field, to do this you would
make a subquery of that field in your WHERE statement, and then SQL would use the 
returned rows to check against.

2) IN the SELECT, FROM, or WHERE statements.

3) You would use a subquery whenever you need to get information from somewhere other
than the immediate table, and bring it into the final query. (has similar utility to
a JOIN)

4) A row constructor is used with WHERE to check some value against a one-time row.

5) The result will be NULL

6) EXISTS, NOT IN, IN, ANY, SOME, ALL

7) employee shift tables:
employee:       shift
id PK           id PK
name            employee_id FK

all employees and shifts:
SELECT * FROM employee, shift;

all possible schedules:
SELECT *

8) these tables seemed poorly constructed...
SELECT (SELECT dogs.name FROM dogs WHERE in_foster = foster_id), * FROM volunteers;
SELECT dog.name, adopter.last_name FROM adoptions WHERE date < '09/17/2017'; 
SELECT adopters.first_name, dogs.name FROM dogs, adopters;
SELECT dogs.name, cats.name, FROM dogs, cats WHERE cat.name, dog.name NOT IN 
(SELECT cat.name, dog.name FROM adoptions;);
SELECT name FROM volunteers WHERE available_to_foster = true;

9) SELECT adoptor.last_name FROM adoptions WHERE adoptions.cat.name = 'SeaShell';

SELECT name FROM patron WHERE id in (SELECT user_id FROM transactions ORDER BY checked_out_date); 
SELECT isbn, title, (SELECT checked_out FROM transactions WHERE transactions.isbn = isbn) FROM books;
SELECT isbn, title, (SELECT SUM(checked_out) FROM transactions WHERE transactions.isbn = isbn)  FROM book; 
SELECT isbn, title FROM books WHERE isbn in (SELECT isbn FROM transactions WHERE checked_out_date < '10/17/2012');
SELECT id, name, (SELECT isbn FROM transactions WHERE user_id = id) FROM patrons;

11) 
SELECT airplane_model FROM flights WHERE flight_number in 
(SELECT flight_number FROM transactions WHERE seats_sold > 100 AND date < '09/17/2017');

SELECT destination, origin FROM flights WHERE flight_number in
(SELECT flight_number FROM transactions WHERE date < '09/17/2017' AND
seats_sold/seat_capacity > 0.9);

SELECT total_revenue FROM transactions WHERE flight_number in 
(SELECT flight_number FROM flights WHERE origin = 'Atlanta');
