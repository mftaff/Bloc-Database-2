1) the numbers are all the same data-type and meaning as each other, the values 
for 1,2 and 4 are also the same data-type/meaning as each other, and the value for
3 is the same data-type as the numbers, but the same meaning as the values.

2) A database might be used whenever data is required to persist past the life of
a session, and/or across multiple platforms/access points.

3) One difference between SQL and other languages is that SQL is a declarative 
language (you tell SQL what you want, not how to get what you want), whereas other
languages may be a procedural language (you tell the program how to do things)\

4) A database can be structured as follows: A file stores data in a binary format,
the data is stored in tables with columns (of labels) and rows (of data). You then
use some language to access/edit those tables.

5)  table = place to store one type of data
    row = one instance of data for a table
    column = one attribute that the table's data needs to have
    value = what any instance (of a row) has at a given column location
    
6) string, integer, date
